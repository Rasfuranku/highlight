### HIGHLIGHTED TEXT OR REFERENCES
This is an add-on extension for Mozilla to save references taken from texts hightlighted by the user.

# Current state
This is the very first version, it will include the possibility to highlight the text and inject elements into the DOM so it could be saved for later.
